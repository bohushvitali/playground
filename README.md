# Concepts
- Evolutionary Architectures
  - An evolutionary architecture supports incremental, guided change as a first principle across multiple dimensions.
- Autonomous Clusters
  - Package Kubernetes clusters as images and run them anywhere.
- Gherkin Language
  - Gherkin is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language created especially for behavior descriptions.
- Statecharts
  - Statecharts are a precise way of modeling the behaviour of complex reactive systems.
- Service Mesh
  - A service mesh is a configurable infrastructure layer for a microservices application.
- Linked Data
  - Linked data is a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through semantic queries.
- Micro Frontends
  - Micro frontends are a way of structuring the UI of a site around a series of independent fragments, extending the benefits of microservice architecture to frontend development.
- Web Components
  - Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.
